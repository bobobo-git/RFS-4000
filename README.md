RFS 4000

i stumbled upon this rfs4000 controller with software wing 5.2   

*the history of the ownership-changings over the years show that this device is somehow strange*

one problem i had was to shutdown the device correct.   
i found the shutdown button in the Wing under Operations, then the device rfs4000-xxxxx, the device details at the bottom of the pwge.  
There yu can select at least a halt button near the execute button.
